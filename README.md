# Team RAWR Sponsor Browser Source

Welcome Team RAWR members! 🎉  

This repository provides a **single, centralized browser source** to display all Team RAWR sponsors, including the RAWR logo. With this setup, you **don’t need multiple sources** in OBS — everything is handled automatically.

---

## Features

- ✅ **Displays RAWR logo** and all sponsors in rotation.
- ✅ **Self-updating**: Any new sponsors added to the repository automatically update the browser source.
- ✅ **Clean and professional** display with smooth fade transitions.
- ✅ **Easy to use**: just add the Browser Source URL in OBS.

---

## How to Use

1. **Open OBS** → Add a **Browser Source**.  
2. Paste the URL of the browser source: https://kingkrazey.github.io/RAWR/RAWR-Sponsors.html
3. Set your desired width/height (default works fine) and ensure **"Shutdown source when not visible"** is unchecked.  
4. The source will automatically rotate through all sponsors, always starting with the RAWR logo.

---

## How It Works

1. **Sponsor Images**  
   All sponsor logos are stored in the `/assets/` folder. Sponsors will be added/removed when needed by the team.  

2. **Automatic Updates**  
   Whenever the repo is updated with new sponsors, the browser source will automatically display them without any changes on your end.
